This project represents the final assignment for the course I completed. It showcases the knowledge and skills I gained throughout the program, 
including my ability to work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Through this project, I was able to apply the concepts learned and demonstrate my proficiency in front-end development,
as well as my understanding of web design principles."

Let me know if you want to adjust or add anything!
